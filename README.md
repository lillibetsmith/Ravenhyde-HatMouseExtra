# Ravenhyde-HatMouseExtra

This was written for Stardew Valley 1.5 and has not been tested in 1.6. The mod is designed to use Shop Tile Framework and Content Patcher. (Shop Tile Framework needs Extended Preconditions Utility to work.) 

If you do not use Content Patcher, you can remove the folder "[CP]HatMouseExtra"; it is optional and just changes the Hat Mouse's initial announcement mail.

Installation instructions: drag the "Hat Mouse Extra" folder into your mods folder.

What this mod does: This mod adds Community Center completion items into the Hat Mouse's shop (in other words, the Hat Mouse kindasorta went into competition with the Traveling Cart). 

Modding the mod: You can change the value after "MaxItemsSoldinShop" to whatever value you like.
